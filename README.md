## What is Test case??
A test case is a singular set of actions or instructions for a tester to perform that validates a specific aspect of a product 
or application functionality. If the test fails, the result might be a software defect that the organization can triage.

## What is Bug-Report?
A software bug report contains specific information about what is wrong and what needs to be fixed in software or on a website. 
These comprehensive reports include requests or specifics for each software issue.

## Why do we need Test Cases?
The purpose of a test case is to determine if different features within a system are performing as expected and to confirm that the system satisfies all related standards, guidelines and customer requirements. 
The process of writing a test case can also help reveal errors or defects within the system.

## Why do we need bug report?
Bug reporting is an effective way to let software developers know about issues with their software. 
Bug reporting can help software developers fix the bug and make the software more reliable.
